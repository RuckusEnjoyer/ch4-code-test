# Coding Test

## Description
This is a challenge of my skills in Javascript and my knowledge in APIs. This test is a short quiz on javascript and APIs utilizing the things I have learned in the past two weeks. 

I have a few bugs that may need fixing in this version, including the timer being broken and some styling being missing. The incorrect/correct announcer is also bugged. This will be fixed in future versions.

## Usability

To play this quiz, click on the start button. A timer will appear along with the first question. If you answer incorrectly, ten seconds will be subtracted from the timer. Your final score will be how much time remains.
